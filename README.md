# counter-code
 I count things with Python code, 
 to learn how to count things...
 using Python code.
 
I also count how many selfish words like "my", 
"me", "mine" and "I",  "I've", "I'd", and "I'll".

Next I should count special symbols in a file, 
meaning ones on the F1-F12 keys and others along
the right side of the character keyboard, i.e. 
comma, dot, semi-colon, single quote, left and
right brackets, etc.
